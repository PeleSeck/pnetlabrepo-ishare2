```linux
This script allows to upgrade PNETLab from almost any version to v5.2.8
It cannot be used when version is 6.0.x

File 5.2.8.zip will be downloaded from unetlab.cloud
```
## upgrade.sh

`It cannot be used in cases where PNETLab version is 6.0.x. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed and the script execution will be finished`

`Also, this script detects if you already have PNETLab v5.2.8 in your system and avoids to upgrade twice`
